Application deployment and management should be automated, auditable, and easy to understand and that's what beetle tries to achieve in a simple manner. Beetle automates the deployment and rollback of your applications in a multi-cluster, multi-namespaces kubernetes environments. Easy to integrate with through API endpoints & webhooks to fit a variety of workflows.


## Documentation

## Deployment

### On a Linux Server

Download [the latest Beetle binary.](https://github.com/Clivern/Beetle/releases)

```zsh
$ curl -sL https://github.com/Clivern/Beetle/releases/download/x.x.x/beetle_x.x.x_OS.tar.gz | tar xz
```

Create your config file as explained on [development part](#development) and run beetle with systemd or anything else you prefer.

```
$ ./beetle -config=/custom/path/config.prod.yml
```


## Development

Beetle uses Go Modules to manage dependencies. First Create a prod config file.

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/Clivern/Beetle.git
$ cp config.dist.yml config.prod.yml
```

Then add your default configs. You probably wondering how the following configs even work! let's pick one and explain.

The item mode: `${BEETLE_APP_MODE:-dev}` means that the mode is dev unless environment variable `BEETLE_APP_MODE` is defined. so you can always override the value by defining the environment variable `export BEETLE_APP_MODE=prod`. and same for others

```yaml
# App configs
app:
    # Env mode (dev or prod)
    mode: ${BEETLE_APP_MODE:-dev}
    # HTTP port
    port: ${BEETLE_API_PORT:-8080}
    # App URL
    domain: ${BEETLE_APP_DOMAIN:-http://127.0.0.1:8080}
    # TLS configs
    tls:
        status: ${BEETLE_API_TLS_STATUS:-off}
        pemPath: ${BEETLE_API_TLS_PEMPATH:-cert/server.pem}
        keyPath: ${BEETLE_API_TLS_KEYPATH:-cert/server.key}

    # Message Broker Configs
    broker:
        # Broker driver (native)
        driver: ${BEETLE_BROKER_DRIVER:-native}
        # Native driver configs
        native:
            # Queue max capacity
            capacity: ${BEETLE_BROKER_NATIVE_CAPACITY:-5000}
            # Number of concurrent workers
            workers: ${BEETLE_BROKER_NATIVE_WORKERS:-4}

    # Application Database
    database:
        # Database driver (mysql)
        driver: ${BEETLE_DATABASE_DRIVER:-mysql}
        # MySQL DB Configs
        mysql:
            # MySQL Hostname
            host: ${BEETLE_DATABASE_MYSQL_HOST:-localhost}
            # MySQL Port
            port: ${BEETLE_DATABASE_MYSQL_PORT:-3306}
            # MySQL Database
            database: ${BEETLE_DATABASE_MYSQL_DATABASE:-beetle}
            # MySQL Username
            username: ${BEETLE_DATABASE_MYSQL_USERNAME:-root}
            # MySQL Password
            password: ${BEETLE_DATABASE_MYSQL_PASSWORD:- }

    # Supported Notifications Webhooks
    webhooks:
        -
            name: http_service
            type: http
            url: http://example.com/api/listen
            method: post
            headers:
                - X-AUTH-TOKEN=1234
            events:
                - deployment
                - rollback

    # Kubernetes Clusters
    clusters:
        -
            # kubernetes cluster name
            name: ${BEETLE_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_NAME:-default}

            # kubernetes cluster kubctl config
            kubeconfig: ${BEETLE_DEFAULT_CLUSTER_CONFIG:-/app/config/default-kubctl.yaml}

            # Enabled Notifications Webhooks
            notify:
                - http_service

# Log configs
log:
    # Log level, it can be debug, info, warn, error, panic, fatal
    level: ${BEETLE_LOG_LEVEL:-info}
    # output can be stdout or abs path to log file /var/logs/beetle.log
    output: ${BEETLE_LOG_OUTPUT:-stdout}
    # Format can be json
    format: ${BEETLE_LOG_FORMAT:-json}
```

And then run the application.

```zsh
$ go build beetle.go
$ ./beetle

// OR

$ make run

// To Provide a custom config file
$ ./beetle -config=/custom/path/config.prod.yml
$ go run beetle.go -config=/custom/path/config.prod.yml
```
